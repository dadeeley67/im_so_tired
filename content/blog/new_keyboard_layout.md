## New Keyboard Layout

This is very difficult. I am trying to learn a new keyboard layout, the Colemak layout, specifically. It is pretty weird and kind of fun, honestly, but it is very hard. I am typing so, so slowly. This entire paragraph has taken me, like, five minutes. It is hilariously difficult. I’m not sure how long I can actually make this post because it is just taking me so long to type it all out. If I’m going to dive into this cold turkey, I’m going to have to just do the exercises I found on the Colemak website. In fact, I’m going to go do that now. Bye bye.
